America has made my fortune.

4
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,100
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

5
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,780
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,180
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

7
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,540
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

9
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,780
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

10
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,300
They made her drink whiskey

11
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,580
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

12
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,620
She resisted, she kept her honor.

13
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,780
So they beat her like an animal.

14
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,300
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

15
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,660

held together by wire.

16
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,100
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,380
But I wept. Why did I weep?

18
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,180
She was the light of my life.

19
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,700
Beautiful girl.

20
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,100

I went to the police,

24

These two boys were brought to trial.

25
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,460
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

26
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,580

27

But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

41
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,700
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

46
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,340
You didn't need a friend like me.

47
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,300
But now you come to me and say,

48
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,740
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "

49
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,260
But you don't ask with respect.

50
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,860
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

51
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,140
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

BONASERA: I ask you for justice.

53
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,620
That is notjustice.
Your daughter is alive.

54
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,940

would be suffering this very day.

make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

Please, Michael. Tell me.

When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

184
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,140
with a big bandleader.

185
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,260
And as his career got better and better ,
he wanted to get out of it.

186
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,860
Johnny is my father's godson.

187
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,140
My father went to see this bandleader.

188
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,980
He offered him $ 10 ,000
to let Johnny go,

189
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,700
but the bandleader said no.

190
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,940
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

191
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,780
Within an hour ,

192
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,100
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1 ,000.

193
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,860
-How did he do that?
-Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

194
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,140
-What was that?
-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

195
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,220
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

I need a million dollars in cash.

I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

-What is the interest for my family?
-30%.

348
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,620
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

349

And then it would go up.

350

354

That's right.

Why do I deserve this generosity?

And I'll give you my reason.

363
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,660
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

364
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,140
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

365
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:24,620
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:04,700
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1003
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:07,060
I didn't tell Mama anything.

1004
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:11,140
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

1005
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,580
But you needed a drink first.

1006
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,020
Yeah.

1007
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,580
Well, now you've had your drink.

1008
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:34,660
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1009
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:53,420
I want no inquiries made.

1010
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:00,140
I want no acts of vengeance.

1011
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:04,500
I want you to arrange a meeting

1012
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,980
with the heads of the five families.

1013
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:11,820
This war stops now.

1014
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:35,300
Call Bonasera.

1015
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:37,500
I need him now.

1016
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:54,300
This is Tom Hagen.  calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

1017
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:56,700
You owe your Don a service.

1018
01:56:56,780 --> 01:57:00,220
<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

1019
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:04,420
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

1020
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:29,340
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

1021
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:32,420
Yes. What do you want me to do?

1022
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:44,740
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

1023
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:51,500
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1024
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:09,860
Look how they massacred my boy.

1037

This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1038
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:33,580
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

1039

Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

1048
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,860
Okay, anything you say.

1049

She wants to drive.

She'll make a good American wife.

VITO: Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

1059
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:45,540
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

1060
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:50,260
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

1061
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:53,500
and from Brooklyn

1062
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:57,060
Philip Tattaglia.

1063
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:01,380
And from Staten Island

1064
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:04,820
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1065
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:10,300
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

1066
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:13,980
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

1067
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:23,860
How did things ever get so far?

1068
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:25,500
I don't know.

1069
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:30,820
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

1070
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:37,140
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

1071
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:42,740
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

1072
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:46,660
then  willing to let things go on
as before.

1073
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:56,820
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

1074
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:00,820
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

1075
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:04,900
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1076
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:07,780
He refused to share them.

1077
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:11,460
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1078
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:13,820
All of you know me.

1079
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:19,700
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1080
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:26,900
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1081
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:31,060
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1082
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:36,860
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

1083
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:41,460
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1084
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:45,620
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1085
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:50,580
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1086
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:52,780
Times have changed.

1087
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,460
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1088
02:03:57,540 --> 02:04:00,260
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1089
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:05,540
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1090
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:10,020
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1091
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:14,500
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1092
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:17,060
After all, we're not communists.

1093
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:23,020
I also don't believe in drugs.

1094
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:27,780
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1095
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:30,900
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

1096
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:34,340
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

1097
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,820
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

1098
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:43,940
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1099
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:48,580
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1100
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:50,420
<i>That's an inf√†mia.</i>

1101
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:55,460
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1102
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:58,580
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1103
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:08,380
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1104
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:16,100
And  willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1105
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:20,980
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1106
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:25,220
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1107
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:28,900
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1108
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:32,180
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

1109
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:34,740
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1110
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:39,780
BARZINI : We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1111
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:42,660
You talk about vengeance.

1112
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:45,860
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1113
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:48,340
Or my boy to me?

1114
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:51,100
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1115
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:56,020
But I have selfish reasons.

1116
02:05:58,180 --> 02:06:01,620
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1117
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:05,860
because of this Sollozzo business.

1118
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:11,060
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1119
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,700
Cleared of all these false charges.

1120
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:18,140
But  a superstitious man.

1121
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:23,300
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¬§,

1122
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:28,100
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1123
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:30,900
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1124
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,580
then  going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1125
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:39,420
And that I do not forgive.

1126
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:44,060
But, that aside

1127
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:49,300
let me say that I swear

1128
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:53,820
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1129
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:58,100
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1130
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:27,820
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1131
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:29,900
Mention it. Don't insist.

1132
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:36,540
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.

1133
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,980
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1134
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:44,020
He could never have outfought Santino.

1135
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:51,660
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1136
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:08,500
Come on, Nancy.

1137
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:12,140
Keep together , everyone. Brian.

1138
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:15,020
Okay, all right.

1139
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:29,660
How long have you been back?

1140
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:32,180
I've been back a year.

1141
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,580
Longer than that, I think.

1142
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:40,380
It's good to see you, Kay.

1143
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:53,380
working for my father now, Kay.

1144
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:58,660
He's been sick. Very sick.

1145
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:02,020
But you're not like him.

1146
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:05,740
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1147
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:11,740
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1148
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:15,180
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1149
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:18,660
Like a senator or president.

1150
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:21,100
-How naive you sound.
-Why?

1151
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:23,860
They don't have men killed.

1152
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:28,860
Who's being naive, Kay?

1153
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:34,180
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1154
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:39,860
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1155
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:45,420
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1156
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:49,780
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1157
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:55,700
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1158
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:59,140
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1159
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:02,900
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.

1160
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:07,020
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...

1161
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:12,420
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1162
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:18,260
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1163
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:22,860
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1164
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:26,980
That we have children. Our children.

1165
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,500
Kay, I need you.

1166
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,900
And I love you.

1167
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,740
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel

-M ICHAEL: Be patient.

Just take off the handcuffs.

CARLO: We must protect ourselves.

1171
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:11,900
-Let me recruit some new men.
-M ICHAEL: No.

1172
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:15,700
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.

1173
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:19,260
CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...

1174
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:23,260
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1175
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:27,220
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1176
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:30,780
Michael is now head of the family.

1177
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:34,940
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1178
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:37,340
After we make the move to Nevada

1179
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:41,620
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1180
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:45,860
-TESSIO: How long will that be?
-Six months.

1181
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:49,060
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1182
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,860
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1183
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:57,380
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1184
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:00,260
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.

1185
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:03,140
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.

1186
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:06,380
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1187
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:16,220
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1188

That's all I can tell you now.

1189
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:21,820
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1190

When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1191
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:29,780
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1192
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:32,300
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1193
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:36,900
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1194
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:59,780
-Thank you, Papa.
- happy for you, Carlo.

You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

Tom.

1199
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:22,300
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1200
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:26,340
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1201
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:30,820
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1202
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:36,540
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1203
02:13:37,540 --> 02:13:40,460
-Maybe I could help.
-You're out, Tom.

He had some business. He said to

Mike, what can I do?

1233
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:25,540
We're thinking of giving up our interests

in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1235
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:34,340
Moe will sell us his share of the casino

-Tom!
-Are you sure?

1237
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:40,020
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1238
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:42,700
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

would draw gamblers to the casino.

Yes. First of all, you're all done.

Moe didn't mean nothing by that.
